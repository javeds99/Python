# Python

This project looked at data from InstaCart, an online grocery store. Using Python, we were able to indentify trends and patterns in the data that were insightful to the sharholders and CEO's of the company. The data contains information on InstaCart's customers such as their name, age, marital status, and what they purchase. The data also contains the names of the products carried by InstaCart, and their corresponding number. Python was used to identify InstaCart's busiest days, busiest times of the day, most frequent customers, and the driving factors that impact revenue.
